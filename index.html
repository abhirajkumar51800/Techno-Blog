    <div class="heading margin"><h2>What is Computer Vision?</h2></div>
    <div class="margin"><p>Computer vision is a field of study which enables computers to replicate the human visual system. Itâ€™s a subset of artificial intelligence which collects information from digital images or videos and processes them to define the attributes. The entire process involves image acquiring, screening, analysing, identifying and extracting information. This extensive processing helps computers to understand any visual content and act on it accordingly. 
        Computer vision projects translate digital visual content into explicit descriptions to gather multi-dimensional data. This data is then turned into computer-readable language to aid the decision-making process. The main objective of this branch of artificial intelligence is to teach machines to collect information from pixels. </p></div>

    <div class="margin"><h2>How does Computer Vision Work?</h2></div>
    <div class="margin"><p>Computer Vision primarily relies on pattern recognition techniques to self-train and understand visual data. The wide availability of data and the willingness of companies to share them has made it possible for deep learning experts to use this data to make the process more accurate and fast. 
        While machine learning algorithms were previously used for computer vision applications, now deep learning methods have evolved as a better solution for this domain. For instance, machine learning techniques require a humongous amount of data and active human monitoring in the initial phase monitoring to ensure that the results are as accurate as possible. Deep learning on the other hand, relies on neural networks, and uses examples for problem solving. It self-learns by using labeled data to recognise common patterns in the examples.</p></div>

        <div class="margin"><h2>How to learn Computer Vision? </h2></div>
        <div class="margin"><p>Depending on the uses, computer vision has the following uses:</p></div>
        <div class="margin"><p>Laying the Foundation: Probability, statistics, linear algebra, calculus and basic statistical knowledge are prerequisites of getting into the domain. Similarly, knowledge of programming languages like Python and MATLAB will help you grasp the concepts better.
            Digital Image Processing: Learn how to compress image and videos using JPEG and MPEG files. Knowledge of basic image processing tools like histogram equalisation, median filtering and more are required. Once you know the basics of image processing and restoration, you will be ready to pick up the more critical skills of computer vision.
            Machine Learning Basics: Knowledge of Convoluted Neural Networks, fully connected neural networks, support vector machines, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial network, and autoencoders are necessary to get started with computer vision.
            Basic Computer Vision: The next step in the process is to decode the mathematical models involved in the image and video formulations. Once you understand how pattern recognition and signal processing works, you can get into advanced learning.</p></div>
        <div class="margin"><h2>Job Description of Computer Vision Engineer</h2></div>
